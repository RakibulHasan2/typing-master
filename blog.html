                      The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed. Session storage is a popular choice when it comes to storing data on a browser. It enables developers to save and retrieve different values. Unlike local storage, session storage only keeps data for a particular session. The data is cleared once the user closes the browser window.

                      The global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like. Block scopes are different from function scopes in JavaScript. A function scope is created for every function. We often identify those scopes as local scopes and identify the top-level scope as the global scope. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like. You can also use them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not to be confused with empty object literals.

                      he event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event"). The event loop is also sometimes referred to as the message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop.When the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program, as it often does, it may be termed the main loop or main event loop. This title is appropriate, because such an event loop is at the highest level of control within the program.
